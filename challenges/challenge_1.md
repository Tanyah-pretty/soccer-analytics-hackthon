# Challenge 1: Talent Identification System

## Background
Identifying promising young talent early is a critical competitive advantage in soccer. Teams that can spot future stars before they become widely recognized can secure them at lower costs and develop them into valuable assets.

## Challenge Description
Develop a machine learning model that can identify emerging talent in the EPL data. Your system should:

1. Identify key performance indicators that predict future success
2. Account for player age, position, and development trajectory
3. Differentiate between immediate performance and long-term potential
4. Provide explainable predictions that scouts can understand

## Data Resources
- Player biographical data (age, position, physical attributes)
- Season and match performance statistics
- Historical progression of players who became stars
- Team context and playing opportunities

## Technical Requirements
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and transform raw EPL data into meaningful features
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create innovative metrics that capture player potential
3. **Model Building**: Develop predictive models using appropriate ML techniques
4. **Evaluation**: Define and measure success metrics for your talent identification system
5. **Visualization**: Create clear visualizations that communicate your findings

## Evaluation Criteria
- Innovation in feature engineering (30%)
- Model accuracy and robustness (25%)
- Technical implementation (20%)
- Quality of visualizations and explainability (15%)
- Potential real-world applicability (10%)

## Deliverables
1. Technical documentation explaining your approach
2. Source code with well-documented implementation
3. A dashboard or visualization tool for talent identification
4. A 5-minute presentation on your solution

## Starter Code
See the [examples/player_analysis.ipynb](../examples/player_analysis.ipynb) notebook for a starting point on accessing and analyzing player data.

## Tips for Success
- Think about what makes a player valuable beyond obvious statistics
- Consider positional differences when evaluating potential
- Look at historical examples of players who succeeded or failed to meet expectations
- Create visualizations that would be meaningful to scouts and managers
