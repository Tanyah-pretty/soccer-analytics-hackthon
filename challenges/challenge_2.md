# Challenge 2: Performance Analytics Innovation

## Background
Traditional soccer statistics often fail to capture the full contribution of players. Goals and assists are easily measured, but many crucial aspects of performance remain difficult to quantify. Advanced metrics can provide deeper insights into player and team performance beyond these basic statistics.

## Challenge Description
Create innovative new performance metrics that provide more meaningful and comprehensive evaluations of players. Your solution should:

1. Develop novel metrics that capture aspects of performance not covered by conventional statistics
2. Use data visualization to communicate complex performance insights
3. Compare your metrics to traditional statistics to show their added value
4. Apply your metrics to identify undervalued players in the EPL

## Data Resources
- Detailed match statistics for all players
- Event data (passes, shots, tackles, etc.)
- Team performance context
- Positional information

## Technical Requirements
1. **Metric Definition**: Clearly define your new metrics and their calculation
2. **Statistical Validation**: Demonstrate that your metrics measure meaningful aspects of performance
3. **Visualization**: Create intuitive visualizations that communicate your metrics
4. **Application**: Apply your metrics to identify patterns or insights not visible with traditional statistics
5. **Evaluation**: Show how your metrics correlate with team success or player value

## Evaluation Criteria
- Innovation and originality of metrics (35%)
- Statistical validity and robustness (25%)
- Quality of visualization and communication (20%)
- Practical applicability for teams and scouts (20%)

## Deliverables
1. Documentation explaining your metrics and methodology
2. Implementation code for calculating your metrics
3. Visualization dashboard showcasing your analytics
4. Case studies applying your metrics to specific players or teams
5. A 5-minute presentation on your findings

## Starter Code
See the [examples/team_performance.ipynb](../examples/team_performance.ipynb) notebook for examples of working with team and player performance data.

## Tips for Success
- Think about aspects of play that aren't captured by traditional statistics
- Consider contextual factors like quality of opponents and game situations
- Explore metrics that evaluate player contributions to team success
- Look at how metrics vary across different positions and playing styles
