# Challenge 3: Transfer Strategy Optimization

## Background
Soccer teams must make strategic decisions about which players to acquire and sell. These decisions involve balancing performance needs, financial constraints, and long-term development goals. A data-driven approach to transfer strategy can help teams make more effective decisions and gain a competitive advantage.

## Challenge Description
Build a recommendation system that suggests optimal player transfers for EPL teams. Your system should:

1. Analyze team performance gaps and identify positions needing reinforcement
2. Recommend players that would improve team performance based on playing style compatibility
3. Consider financial constraints and return on investment
4. Balance immediate impact with long-term team development

## Data Resources
- Team performance statistics and playing styles
- Player performance data across multiple seasons
- League standings and competition results
- Team composition by position and age

## Technical Requirements
1. **Team Analysis**: Develop methods to evaluate team strengths and weaknesses
2. **Player Matching**: Create algorithms to match players to team needs
3. **Optimization**: Balance multiple constraints (budget, squad size, etc.)
4. **Simulation**: Model the potential impact of recommended transfers
5. **Visualization**: Create intuitive interfaces for decision-makers

## Evaluation Criteria
- Sophistication of team needs analysis (25%)
- Quality of player-team matching algorithms (25%)
- Effectiveness of optimization approach (20%)
- Impact modeling and ROI calculations (15%)
- Quality of visualization and user interface (15%)

## Deliverables
1. Transfer recommendation system implementation
2. Documentation explaining your methodology
3. Interactive dashboard for exploring recommendations
4. Sample analysis for at least three EPL teams
5. A 5-minute presentation demonstrating your solution

## Starter Code
See the [examples/transfer_analysis.ipynb](../examples/transfer_analysis.ipynb) notebook for examples of analyzing team needs and player fit.

## Tips for Success
- Consider both statistical and tactical fit when matching players to teams
- Think about age profiles and development potential for long-term planning
- Include financial considerations like transfer fees and wages
- Account for positional priorities and depth requirements
- Look at successful transfers from the past and identify patterns
